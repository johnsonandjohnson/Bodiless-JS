<!-- OPENING NOTE & REMINDER TO THE DEVELOPERS:

    - The most important thing in these curriculum lessons is INFORMATION.
      - Do not worry about prettiness (e.g., formatting) or spelling/punctuation.
        The technical writer will take these and clean them up later.
    - Some tasks may not need to use all the sections listed below, and that is ok.
-->

<!-- INTRODUCTION

    Use this section to _introduce_ the topic/task.
    What this looks like may differ depending on the task.

    - Keep in mind that the next section is the "Overview," which will describe what you are doing,
      and why.
      So, this should set up the reader for what they'll read in the "Overview," and provide them
      with any necessary context.
    - For example, you could provide links to any resources necessary/beneficial to getting started.
    - Don't use an "Introduction" header — just roll into your intro.
-->

## Overview

<!-- Describe what you'll be doing in this task and why (if relevant). -->

## Assignment

<!--
    Explain, using Bodiless terminology, how a developer should accomplish this task.

    - Feel free to reference other documents or examples.
      - If there aren't existing examples showcasing what you want, then provide some.
      - If there isn't documentation discussing a particular topic or detail that is relevant to
        your task, you may need to write it and add it to the appropriate location in documentation.
        - Ultimately, this curriculum should just be an onboarding tool, and all the _actual_
          documentation should live outside of this curriculum and be in its appropriate place. This
          curriculum can then link to any of that relevant documentation.
-->

## Practice

<!--
    Come up with a new task for the reader to perform that is similar in nature to the lesson they
    just completed, allowing them to practice what they've learned.
-->

## Resources

<!--
    Link to any resources you found/used to help you accomplish this task.

    - Link to pages/sections within the Bodiless documentation or the API docs.

    TIP: When searching for resources in the Bodiless documentation, don't rely on the Docsify
         search; instead, use the search in VS Code.

    questions a new developer may have — document the Questions and Answers here.
