        This page is designed to demostrate/test the performance of flow containers
        and Chameleons with a very large number of available components. If the system
        is operating properly, this page should load fairly quickly. Note that there
        will be a slight delay when opening the component selector.

        NOTE: The classes used to style these variations are generated dynamically, and
        will be purged on the static version of this page.
