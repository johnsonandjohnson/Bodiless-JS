# Anatomy of a Token

Before we go further, it will help to understand how tokens are constructed
and applied.

For reference, let's look at the `Welcome` token we created in our
upstream library. You will recall this combines the `Default` token with some
additional styling and content.  It is equivalent to the following:

```ts
const Welcome = asDialogToken({
  Theme: {
    TitleWrapper: 'Dialog-title',
    MessageWrapper: 'Dialog-message',
    Border: addProps({ color: FancyBorderColor.Blue }),
  },
  Content: {
    Title: addProps({ children: 'Welcome!' }),
    Message: addProps({ children: 'Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!' }),
  },
});
```

As we mentioned before, a token is a structured set of higher order components
which can be applied to a component.  These are structured as a two-layer
nested object.

The outer keys of the object (`Theme`, `Content`) are called "Domains" and are
used to divide the token into functional sections which can be extended or
overridden independently. You can read more about the specific domains defined
in the VitalDS and their usage [here](). The inner keys of this object
(`TitleWrapper`, `MessageWrapper`, `Border`, etc) correspond to the "slots"
exposed by the clean component. They are sometimes referred to as "Design Keys".
Note, that in addition to the internal design keys exposed by the component,
you can also specify the special `_` key here to specify a token which should
be applied to the component as a whole, as we did in the original dialog tokens
from [Composition From Without](./ComposingFromWithout.md):

```ts
const Welcome = asElementToken({
  Theme: {
    _: addProps({ color: FancyBorderColor.Blue }),
  },
  Content: {
    _: addProps({
        title: 'Welcome',
        message: 'Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!',
    }),
  },
});
```

The *values* of the inner keys represent higher order components which should
be applied to the specified slot. Each can be expressed as 
- A function, which will be interpreted as a higher order component
- A string, which will be interpreted as a list of classes to be added via the
  [addClasses]() utility
- Another token, which will be converted to a HOC.

To apply a token to a component, you use the `as` utility, which converts the token
to a higher order component. For example:

```ts
const WelcomeDialog = as(Welcome)(Dialog);
```

`as` accepts a list of tokens, strings or functions and interprets them exactly as
described above -- creating a single HOC which applies the tokens in order to the
component.

Note also the use of `asDialogToken` in the example above.  We exported this utility
from our `DialogClean` component:

```ts
const asDialogToken = asVitalTokenSpec<DialogComponents>();
```

Every token you create must be similarly wrapped. This:
- provides type safety for the domains and design keys.
- ensures that the domains are in the correct order.
- Allows you to merge multiple tokens.

So whenever you create a new clean component, be sure to export an `as..Token`
utility to help your downstream consumers create new tokens.

## Some thigs to remember

### Tokens are Javascript Objects
  Even though they compose Higher Order Components, tokens are really just plain
  old Javascript objects, and can be composed using normal spread syntax:

  ```ts
  const Welcome = asDialogToken({
    ...Default,
    Theme: {
      ...Default.Theme,
      Border: addProps({ color: FancyBorderColor.Blue }),
    },
    ...
  ```
### Order is Important
  The order in which tokens are applied can make a difference.  Consider the following:
  ```ts
  const withA: (a: boolean): HOC => C => props => <C {...props} a={a} />
  const WithATrue = asDialogToken({
    Core: {
      _: withA(true),
    }
  })
  const WithAFalse = asDialogToken({
    Core: {
      _: withA(false),
    }
  });

  as(withATrue, WithAFalse)(C) // -> <C a={false} />
  as(withAFalse, WithATrue)(C) // -> <C a={true} />
  ```

  It's important to remember that this is also true for the domains of a single token.
  These are applied in a fixed order (see [Token Domains]()), and those applied
  later will take precedence.
