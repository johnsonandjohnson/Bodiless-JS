# Introducing VitalDS

VitalDS is a white-label component library designed to support flexibility and extensibility while
still maximizing reuse and maintaining the standards that matter most.

It was created specifically to address the needs of large enterprises supporting portfolios of
dramatically different brands with widely varying regional requirements.

The VitalDS components provide:

- Baked in analytics (GA4), SEO, accessibility;
- Out-of-the-box editing with _BodilessJS_, and an abstract data model which makes it simple to
  connect components to your own content sources;
- Cutting-edge front-end performance optimizations to keep bundle size down and Lighthouse scores
  up;
- A modern UI which can be used as-is (with basic theming), extended (with surgical precision), or
  discarded in favor of your own unique designs (while still retaining all the goodies described
  above).

Vital is built on React and Tailwind CSS, and provides starters for both Gatsby and NextJS.

## Ready to Get Started?

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the BodilessJS starters—

```shell
npx @bodiless/cli@next new -r next
```

—and choose `__vital_next__` as the template site. For more information, see the [BodilessJS
Getting Started Guide](/About/GettingStarted).

Once your site is running locally, walk through the introduction in the following pages to see how
it works. Or, if you're philosophically-minded, read more about [why you might want to use
it](./WhyVital). Working code for all the examples in this curriculum can be found in the
[`vital-examples` package](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/packages/vital-examples ':target=_blank')
and is demonstrated on the
[`vital-examples` site](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/sites/vital-examples ':target=_blank').
If you like, you can copy these directories to your new site and run the examples.
