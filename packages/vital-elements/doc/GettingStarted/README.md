# Introducing Vital-DS

Vital-DS is a white-label component library designed to support flexibility
and extensibility while still maximizing reuse and maintaining the standards
that matter most. 

It was created specifically to address the needs of large enterprises supporting
portfolios of dramatically different brands with widely varying regional
requirements.

The Vital-DS components provide:

- Baked in anlalytics (GA4), SEO, accessibility
- Out-of-the-box editing with *Bodiless-JS* and an abstract data model which
  makes it simple to connect components to your own content sources.
- Cutting edge front-end performance optimizations to keep bundle size down and
  lighthouse scores up.
- A modern UI which can be used as-is (with basic theming), extended (with surgical
 precision), or discarded in favor of your own unique designs (while still
 retaining all the goodies described above).

 Vital is built on React and TailwindCSS, and provides starters for both Gatsby and NextJS.

 ## Ready to get started?

 The easiest way to get started is to use one of the Bodiless-JS starters:
 ```
 npx @bodiless/cli@next new -r next
 ```
 and choose `__vital_next__` as the template site. For more information, see the
 [Bodiless-JS Getting Started Guide]().

Once your site is running locally, walk through the introduction in the following
pages to see how it works.  Or, if you're philosophically minded, read more about
[why you might want to use it](./WhyVital.md).  Working code for all the eexamples
in this curriculum can be found in the [vital-examples package]() and is demonstrated
on the [vital-examples site](). If you like, you can copy these directories to your
new site and run the examples.
