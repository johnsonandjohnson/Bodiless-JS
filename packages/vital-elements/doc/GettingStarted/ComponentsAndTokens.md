# Components and Tokens

The basic building blocks of VitalDS are _Components_ and _Tokens_.

## Components

Unlike many UI libraries, VitalDS provides components which are almost always bare templates. They
do little or nothing in themselves until one or more _tokens_ (see below) are applied to them.
Compound components expose an API which allows tokens to be applied to their constituent elements,
or "slots".

Technically, VitalDS components are plain React functional components wrapped in the FClasses
`designable` and `stylable` APIs, which allow them to be acted on by tokens.

## Tokens

Vital _tokens_ are the meat of VitalDS, where all styling and behavior are encapsulated and
distributed. They are assembled into libraries, and then extended or recomposed by downstream
libraries or sites. In almost every case, you would not export a styled, or otherwise enhanced,
component from your package; instead, you would export a composed token which gives it the look or
behavior you want.

Technically, Vital tokens are expressed as React higher-order components (HOCs), or as objects which
compose several HOCs into a structure which can be more easily recomposed or extended.

?> **Note:** Vital tokens are an extension of the traditional notion of _design tokens_, which
usually represent low-level bits of styling (like colors, fonts, or spacings) which can be applied
across multiple components. Like traditional design tokens, Vital tokens can be applied across
multiple components, but they can represent bits of styling at any level. A layout, a color scheme,
or a data binding can all be represented as Vital tokens.

Okay, enough talk. Let's dive into some code to see how these blocks fit together.
