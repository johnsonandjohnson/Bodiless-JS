# CanvasX Layout Component

TBD

?> **Tip:** While building out Layout, it's recommended to leave the existing CanvasX component —
or, if new, stub out the component and render a text placeholder — you can return to particular
component later in the site build. Focus on the general structure of header, footer, etc. here, and
leave the details for a later step in the process.
