# bugs
1) In editor mode, when I click on move (either awy) I only get to first & last slide and not any in between.

2) Static Bug https://bodiless-js-next-git-fork-hvanyo-feat-carousel-jnj-demo-account.vercel.app/styleguide/carousel/ when renders only shows 3 carousels  (for me when I inspect the rest of carousels show)

3) Carousel dots don't show active.

# variations
