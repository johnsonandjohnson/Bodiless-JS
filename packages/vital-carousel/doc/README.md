1) In editor mode:

For editor of slides (items in list)  old context behavior of the left and right arrows was show next slide (or previous slide).  Now the beavior of the arrows is it actually moves the next slide in list.    Assume this was introduced when we got feature to reorder lists.

For now use Carousel Nav to edit other slides than the first
