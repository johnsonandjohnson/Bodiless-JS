/**
 * Applies the appropriate design to the wrapped component depending on the
 * chameleon state.  Must be called within a context defined by `withChameleonContext`.
 *
 * Use this function when you want to separate the form controlling the chameleon
 * state from the component on which the chameleon acts (for example, if you want
 * to add controls to a component edit form, but actually act on the component
 * to which the edit form was added), eg:
 *
 * ```
 * flowRight(
 *   withDesign({
 *     Disabled: flow(replaceWith('span'), withoutProps('href'), withTitle('Disabled'))
 *   }),
 *   withChameleonContext('link-chameleon'),
 *   withChameleonComponenFormConrols,
 *   asBodilessLink('link')
 *   applyChameleon,
 * )('a');
 * ```
 *
 * Note the use of `withTitle` here.  Only design elements with title metadata will be considered
 * valid chameleon states.
 *
 * @return The wrapped component enhanced by the appropriate HOC's from the design.
