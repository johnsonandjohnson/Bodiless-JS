# Bodiless Scaffold

Bodiless Scaffold is a CLI tool for scaffolding new components, making it easier to ensure that
standards are met. You should use this anytime you are creating a new component or extending an
existing token collection.

## Usage

To use it, run the following command from a local directory:

```bash
npx @bodiless/scaffold@next
```

Follow the prompts to create the new component. The tool will generate the file structure based on
the answers provided and populate it with the necessary files.
