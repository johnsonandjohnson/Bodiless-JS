# Bodiless OIDC

Bodiless OICD is a library that provides OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2 protocol support.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a secure mechanism that is employed in user authentication and authorization and enables an app or a website to contact an identity service provider (like the Akamai or Okta) and authenticate the user, receive an access token that (in the case of Hosted Login) specifies the user profile information that the client is authorized to access, retrieve personal information needed by the user or by the system and refresh the userâ€™s authentication/authorization state, and prevent that session from timing out.
