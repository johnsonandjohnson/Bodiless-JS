# Vital Search Component

Vital Search is based on the [BodilessJS Search](../../../Components/Search/) component.
It adds features and styles specific to VitalDS sites.

?> **Note:** Vital Search re-exports everything Bodiless Search does. This means that, if you're
using Vital Search, you can simply import anything from Bodiless Search using `import { something }
from '@bodiless/vital-search'` instead. This way, you don't have to depend on both
`@bodiless/search` and `@bodiless/vital-search`.
