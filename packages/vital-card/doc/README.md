# Vital Card Component

Vital Card is a group of content which typically features a less than full-size image alongside
supporting content or a call to action (CTA). Cards are commonly used on websites to call out or
offer something to the site visitor.

The Vital Card package provides a clean Card component as well as the following Card design variants
to promote a quicker and easier site build experience:

- Basic Card
- Hero Card
- Horizontal Card
- Vertical Card
- No Title Card
- No Description Card

## Content Editor Details

Other than potentially seeing different style variations available, there is no change to the
general Card component experience by the Vital Card package, and, thus, you can refer to the
[Bodiless Card : Content Editor Details](/Components/Card#content-editor-details).

Cards are composed of a combination of the following parts:

- **Title:** A [Plain Text Editor](../VitalEditors/PlainEditor).
- **Description:** A Basic, no-link, [Rich Text Editor](../VitalEditors/RTE_Editor).
- **Image:** A Gatsby [Image](../VitalImage/).
- **CTA:** A button with a [Link](../VitalLink).

### Hero Card

If your site has been configured with the Hero component, and the _Card_ variation has been enabled,
you can switch an existing Hero component to the Card variation using the Edit Interface.

01. While in [Edit Mode](/ContenteditorUserGuide/#edit-mode), select the desired Hero Component,
    and, within its context menu, under "Hero," click **Swap**.
