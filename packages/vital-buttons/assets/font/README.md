# Regenerating Fonts

Fonts were created with [Fontello](https://fontello.com/).

The icons used are in the `/icons` folder.

To add additional icons and update the font:

01. Upload the SVGs.
01. Set the prefix to `icon-` (under wrench).
01. Name the webfont `buttonicons`.
01. Customize the names and codes.
01. Generate font.

| IMAGE                 | NAME                 | CODE    |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| `ARROW NEXT idle.svg` | `arrow-next-idle_2x` | `E800`  |

**Note:** If you get a warning about unsupported SVGs, you can ignore it if they don't affect your
icon. Otherwise, make sure you export them via the [Fontello
requirements](https://github.com/fontello/fontello/wiki/How-to-use-custom-images).
