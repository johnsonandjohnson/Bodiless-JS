## Disable Page

Select the "Page" checkbox to select all the child feature checkboxes:

* [Menu links](#disable-menu-links)
* [Non-menu links](#disable-non-menu-links)
* [Indexing](#disable-indexing)

Likewise, to _deselect_ all the child feature checkboxes, deselect the "Page" checkbox.

## Disable Menu Links

To disable menu links leading to the current page, select the "Menu links" checkbox.

When disabled, any menu links targeting the current page will not be visible in Static or Review
Mode (i.e., for each of the affected links, neither the anchor element or the link text will be
rendered). Disabled menu links _will_, however, still be visible and functional in Edit Mode.

**Review Mode**

**Edit Mode**

?> **Note:** If a page is published, then it is reachable directly (via its URL) regardless of menu
links being disabled.

## Disable Non-Menu Links

To disable non-menu links leading to the current page, select the "Non-menu links" checkbox.

When disabled, any links targeting the current page — that aren't in menus — will not be visible in
Static or Review Mode (i.e., for each of the affected links, neither the anchor element or the link
text will be rendered). Disabled non-menu links _will_, however, still be visible and functional in
Edit Mode.

non-menu links being disabled.
