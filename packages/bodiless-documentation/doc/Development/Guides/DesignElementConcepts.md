# Design Element Concepts

In this guide, we will continue the [Intro to Bodiless Concepts](./IntroToBodilessConcepts)
tutorial to learn how to use Bodiless Design API tooling to build a design system package.
You can [read more about it here](../../Design/DesignSystem), but at a high level,
is a set of tools and patterns for applying a *Design System* to a React site.
It encourages defining the building blocks of the system (tokens, elements,
components) at the package level, and then applying them consistently across your
site--or even multiple sites, extending and adapting it as needed.

Upon completion of this tutorial, you will end up with code similar to the following:

- [site code](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/sites/minimal-demo/src/data/pages/gallerywithdesign/
':target=_blank').
- [package code](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/packages//minimal-demo/
':target=_blank').

As you go through the tutorial, feel free to reference this code as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [Intro to Bodiless Concepts](./IntroToBodilessConcepts) tutorial.
  - Alternatively, if you already have a fair understanding of BodilessJS
    fundamentals and want to fast-forward to this tutorial,
    [create a new site](../../About/GettingStarted?id=creating-a-new-site) and
    copy over the
    [gallery folder & contents](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/sites/minimal-demo/src/data/pages/gallery)
    from the main bodiless repository, and place in a
    `sites/{your-site-name}/src/data/pages/gallery` directory.
- Read through the high level introduction to the
  [Bodiless Design System](../../Design/DesignSystem). Even if you don't
  follow everything, it will give essential insight into the "why" of
  what you will do in this tutorial.
- Acquire a basic understanding of utility first CSS (aka "Atomic" or "Functional" CSS)
  and the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) library.  There are many excellent
  articles on the web on this topic.  While you can use the Bodiless design system
  with other css-in-js paradigms, this is the one we recommend.

## 1. Typography

In this step, we are going to move typography token definitions from
page level to a package, to ensure consistency across the site.

It would be possible to create our design system entirely at site level, for
example, in a `/sites/{mysite}/src/components` directory. However, we consider
it a best practice to place all code (components and tokens) into a design
system package. This has several advantages:

- it is easy to publish this package so the design system can be used by other sites
- it is easy to reorganize the internal structure of the package without changing imports
  in site level files.
- it is possible to use [Bodiless Token Shadowing](../../VitalDesignSystem/Components/VitalElements/Shadow)
  to override token collections from upstream packages.
- there are performance penalties due to incomplete tree-shaking if you use typescript and
  import core bodiless packages directly from your Gatsby site.

To facilitate creating a design system package, most Bodiless sites are structured as
a *monorepo*, and this is what is created by the `@bodiless/cli new` command you
used to create a new site in the first tutorial.  Your new site should already
contain a stub design system package at `/packages/{your-site-name}`, and that is
where we'll be implementing our design system.

> **Note:**  in the examples below, we assume you have created a new site called `mysite`
using the `__minimal__` template. If you used a different name, then alter file
and variable names accrdingly.

### Create Element component within the package

1. Create a file called `mysiteElement.ts` inside your design system package at
   `packages/mysite/src/components/Element/tokens`, and put the following lines there:

   ```ts
   import { asTokenSpec } from '@bodiless/fclasses';

   const Bold = asTokenSpec()('font-bold');
   const Underline = asTokenSpec()('underline');
   const Italic = asTokenSpec()('italic');
   const SuperScript = asTokenSpec()('align-baseline');
   const Link = asTokenSpec()('text-blue-400', Underline);
   const H1 = asTokenSpec()('text-3xl', Bold);
   const H2 = asTokenSpec()('text-2xl', Bold);
   const H3 = asTokenSpec()('text-xl');
   
   export default {
     Bold,
     Underline,
     Italic,
     Link,
     SuperScript,
     H1,
     H2,
     H3,
   };
   ```

1. Now export these tokens from your package by creating the following files:

   *packages/mysite/src/components/Element/tokens/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import mysiteElement from './mysiteElement';
   
   export default mysiteElement;
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/components/Element/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import mysiteElement from './tokens';
   
   export { mysiteElement };
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/index.ts*

   ```ts
   export * from './components/Element';
   ```

   > Note: There are many ways to organize exports from component packages. Choosing a
   > standard pattern such as the one described above will help keep your code organized
   > and make it easier to maintain. Following this pattern will also allow you to
   > take advantage of some BodilessJS tools for extending and optimizing your design
   > system, like [Token Shadowing]() and [Static Replacement]().

### Update your site to use the new package & Element component

1. Add your package as a dependency in `/sites/mysite/package.json`:

   ```json
   "dependencies:" {
     ...,
     "mysite": "^0.0.0",
   }
   ```

1. Run `npm run setup` from the root of your repository to build your package and link it
   to your site.

1. Now let's use these tokens in our Gallery page. Add the following import to
   `/sites/mysite/src/data/pages/gallery/index.tsx`:

   ```ts
   import { mysiteElement } from 'mysite';
   ```

   And replace the definition of the `PrimaryHeader` component:

   ```ts
   const PrimaryHeader = as(
     asEditable('title', 'Title'),
     mysiteElement.H1,
   )(H1);
   ```

1. Finally, remove the corresponding typography tokens (`asBold`, etc) from
   `/sites/mysite/src/data/pages/gallery/withSimpleEditor.tsx`, and refactor the `simpleDesign`
   to use the tokens we have just created:

   ```ts
   const simpleDesign = {
     Bold: mysiteElement.Bold,
     Italic: mysiteElement.Italic,
     Underline: mysiteElement.Underline,
     Link: as(mysiteElement.Link, asBodilessLink()),
   };
   ```

   Be sure to import `mysiteElement` as before.

In the code above we have created a collection of *element tokens* which apply classes to
basic HTML elements, exported this collection as an object (`mysiteElement`), and used the
tokens to apply typography styling to our text editor and primary header. These
*element tokens* correspond roughly to *atoms* in the parlance of atomic
design. They are usually simple HOC's which add classes or props to the element
(though they may also add behaviors).

> Note the use of `asTokenSpec` to define our tokens. Bodiless tokens are normally
> expressed as React higher order components (HOCs). However, Bodiless provides an
> extended format for describing tokens known as a *Token Specification*. The
> `asTokenSpec()('font-bold')` utility produces a token in this format:
> 
> ```ts
> {
>   Core: {
>     _: 'font-bold',
>   },
> };
> ```
> 
> This  can be converted to a simple HOC via the Bodiless `as` utility:
> 
> ```ts
> const BoldSpan = as(mysiteElement.Bold)(Span);
> ```
> 
> which is identical to:
> 
> ```ts
> const BoldSpan = addClasses('font-bold')(Span);
> ```
> 
> We will go into the uses of token specifications in more detail in a later
> section. For now, you can think of `asTokenSpec` as a utility for creating
> tokens.

### Providing a site-wide rich text editor

To complete the standardization of our site's typography, let's add to the design
system package a rich text editor which uses the standard typography tokens.
Create `packages/mysite/src/components/RichText/tokens/mysiteRichText.ts`:

```ts
import { asTokenSpec, as, stylable } from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { asBodilessLink } from '@bodiless/components-ui';
import { withPlaceholder } from '@bodiless/components';
import { mysiteElement } from '../../Element';

const Simple = asTokenSpec<any>()({
  Core: {
    _: as(stylable, withPlaceholder('Rich text...')),
    Bold: mysiteElement.Bold,
    Italic: mysiteElement.Italic,
    Underline: mysiteElement.Underline,
    Link: as(mysiteElement.Link, asBodilessLink()),
  },
});

export default {
  Simple,
};
```

Export the tokens from the package as you did before for `mysiteElement`:

   *packages/mysite/src/components/RichText/tokens/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import mysiteRichText from './mysiteRichText';
   
   export default mysiteRichText;
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/components/RichText/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import mysiteRichText from './tokens';
   
   export { mysiteRichText };
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/index.ts*

   ```ts
   export * from './components/RichText';
   ```

Rebuild your package (execute `npm run build` from the package directory or
`npm run build:packages` from outside it), and use these tokens in the Gallery.
In `sites/mysite/src/data/pages/gallery/index.tsx`, add these imports:

```ts
import { withNodeKey } from '@bodiless/core';
import { RichText } from '@bodiless/richtext-ui';
import { withPlaceholder } from '@bodiless/components';
import { mysiteElement, mysiteRichText } from 'mysite';
```

and then change:

```ts
const Body = withSimpleEditor('body', 'Body')(Div);
```

to

```ts
const Body = as(
  mysiteRichText.Simple,
  withPlaceholder('Body'),
  withNodeKey('body'),
)(RichText);
```

Similarly, in `sites/mysite/src/data/pages/Gallery/CaptionedImage.tsx`, add the imports
and change

```ts
const Body = as(
  addClasses('text-white bg-black flex-grow p-2'),
  withSimpleEditor('caption', 'Caption')
)(Div);
```

to

```ts
const Body = as(
  mysiteRichText.Simple,
  withPlaceholder('Caption'),
  withNodeKey('caption'),
  addClasses('text-white bg-black flex-grow p-2'),
)(RichText);
```

First, let's look at the `mysiteRichText` token collection. It contains a single
token, `Simple`, expressed as a *token specification*. A token described in this
notation is a 2-level nested object. The inner keys of this object are simply
the design keys of the component to which the token applies, and their values
are higher-order components which should be applied to each element. The top
level keys represent "domains" -- pieces of the token which might be selectively
reused, extended or overridden by a downstream consumer. Here we are using just
a single domain, `Core`. We'll show later on how to define and use multiple
domains to facilitate extension and customization.

In this case, the design keys represent the components which are available in
the editor to render different text formats, as described in [the first tutorial](../IntroToBodilessConcepts#6-configuring-the-rich-text-editor). We apply our
typography tokens to each, thus ensuring that any changes will propagate to all
simple rich text editors on the site.

Note the special design key `_`. Tokens supplied in this key apply to the editor
as a whole. Here we make the editor `stylable` -- that is capable of receiving
classes via the FClasses API. We alo supply a placeholder to be used as a
default, though this will usually be overridden where the editor is used. This is
because the placeholder--like the node key--is usually defined by the context
in which the token is placed, and therefore not reusable.

Applying our token with `as(mysiteRichText.Simple)` is equivalent to the following:

```ts
as(
  withPlaceholder('Rich text...'),
  withDesign({
    Bold: mysiteElement.Bold,
    Italic: mysiteElement.Italic,
    Underline: mysiteElement.Underline,
    Link: as(mysiteElement.Link, asBodilessLink()),
  }),
);
```

At this point, feel free to delete
`/src/data/pages/gallery/withSimpleEditor.tsx` as we have successfully moved
this to the package level.

## 2. Make the Gallery reusable

If you have components which may appear on more than one page in your site (or
be reused across multiple sites) you can export them from your design system
package, and make them "designable" so that they can be easily customized to
implement different variations.

In a Bodiless design system, *components* are usually bare templates which do
little or nothing in themselves until one or more *tokens* are applied to them.
They are often referred to as "clean" components.

A clean component is always "designable" via the
[Bodiless Design API](../Architecture/FClasses?id=the-design-api). That is, it
exposes an api which allows tokens to be applied to constituent elements within
the component. This is very similar to the basic
[slots pattern](https://daveceddia.com/pluggable-slots-in-react-components/) in
React. The key difference is that, with the Design API, we don't inject the
actual React nodes which should be rendered in a particular slot. Instead we
provide a higher order component (a "token") which will be applied to the
component in that slot. This allows us to *layer* styling or behavior for
individual elements.

### Creating a "clean" component

Let's create "clean" versions of our `CaptionedImage` and `Gallery` components.
In `packages/mysite/src/components/CaptionedImage`, create `CaptionedImageClean.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import type { FC, HTMLProps } from 'react';
import {
  ComponentOrTag, DesignableComponentsProps, Img, Section, designable, asTokenSpec, Div,
} from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { RichText } from '@bodiless/richtext-ui';

// Design: set of base components which will be used in the component itself
type CaptionedImageComponents = {
  Wrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Image: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  BodyWrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Body: ComponentOrTag<any>,
};

type CaptionedImageProps =
  HTMLProps<HTMLElement> & DesignableComponentsProps<CaptionedImageComponents>;

// JSX: Bare Template usually with minimal styling/functionality
const CaptionedImageBase: FC<CaptionedImageProps> = ({ components: C, ...rest }) => (
  <C.Wrapper {...rest}>
    <C.Image />
    <C.BodyWrapper>
      <C.Body />
    </C.BodyWrapper>
  </C.Wrapper>
);

// Designable: Define the starting sub-components of the design
const captionedImageComponents: CaptionedImageComponents = {
  Wrapper: Section,
  Image: Img,
  Body: RichText,
  BodyWrapper: Div,
};

const CaptionedImageClean = designable(captionedImageComponents, 'CaptionedImage')(CaptionedImageBase);

const asCaptionedImageToken = asTokenSpec<CaptionedImageComponents>();

export default CaptionedImageClean;
export { asCaptionedImageToken };
```

This exemplifies the 3-step process involved in creating a clean component:

1. Define the "design" of the component. This is a set of base components which
   will be used in the component itself, and which can be targeted by the bodiless
   `withDesign` function (or as inner keys in a token specification).  In the
   `CaptionedImage` component, we define  a design consisting of four components:

   ```ts
   type CaptionedImageComponents = {
     Wrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
     Image: ComponentOrTag<any>,
     Body: ComponentOrTag<any>,
     BodyWrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
   };
   ```
   Each is typed as `ComponentOrTag<any>`, indicating that a React component or
   HTML tag with any prop signature can be used in the slot.

2. Write the JSX code for the component itself.  Usually, this has no styling and
   very little functionality.  It is just a bare template on which styles and
   behaviors can be hung:

   ```ts
   type CaptionedImageProps =
     HTMLProps<HTMLElement> & DesignableComponentsProps<CaptionedImageComponents>;
   const CaptionedImageBase: FC<CaptionedImageProps> = ({ components: C, ...rest }) => (
     <C.Wrapper {...rest}>
       <C.Image />
       <C.Body />
     </C.Wrapper>
   );
   ```

   We use the Bodiless generic type `DesignableComponentsProps` to help define
   the props of our component, which will now include a `components` prop captaining
   the fully styled constituent components which make up the clean component.

3. Make the component "designable":

   ```ts
   const captionedImageComponents: CaptionedImageComponents = {
     Wrapper: Section,
     Image: Img,
     Body: RichText,
     BodyWrapper: Div,
   };
   
   const CaptionedImageClean = designable(captionedImageComponents, 'CaptionedImage')(CaptionedImageBase);
   ```

   In this step, we first define the starting sub-components in our design.
   These are the base components to which any HOC's provided by `withDesign` will
   be applied. Here we use stylable HTML elements exported by
   `@bodiless/fclasses`. Such stylable elements are capable of having their
   `className` prop modified by the [FClasses API]().

   Then, we pass this set of starting components to the Bodiless `designable`
   HOC. A component so wrapped can receive a `design` prop (usually provided by
   `withDesign` or `as`) containing the HOC's which should be applied to each
   constituent. So, for example:

   ```ts
   withDesign({
     Image: 'border',
   });
   ```

   or

   ```ts
   as(
     asTokenSpec<CaptionedImageComponents>)()({
       Core: {
         Image: 'border'
       },
    }),
   );
   ```

   would both apply the `border` class to the `Image` element.

   The second parameter to `designable` is an string which can be used
   to identify the element in the rendered markup.

  ?> **Note:** You will notice there is new addition of a BodyWrapper which will
  render as a simple `div` around the body. We found this was good practice to
  make a wrapper slot for components you expect to have as editors. It allows
  the theme to be applied to the wrapper div and keep separation of theme from
  component. If you replace the body with different type of editor, it will
  maintain the same styles you apply to BodyWrapper div.

### Adding styling & functionality with tokens

As you can see, our clean component has no styling or behavior.  Let's create a
token collection to provide those.

As usual, create `mysiteCaptionedImage.ts` in
`packages/mysite/src/components/CaptionedImage/tokens`:

```ts
import { as } from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { asBodilessImage } from '@bodiless/components-ui';
import { withNodeKey } from '@bodiless/core';
import { withPlaceholder } from '@bodiless/components';
import { mysiteRichText } from '../../RichText';
import { asCaptionedImageToken } from '../CaptionedImageClean';

const Base = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    Wrapper: 'mx-2 h-full flex flex-col',
    Image: as(
      asBodilessImage(),
      'w-full',
      withNodeKey('image'),
    ),
    Body: as(
      mysiteRichText.Simple,
      withPlaceholder('Caption'),
      withNodeKey('caption'),
    ),
    BodyWrapper: 'text-white bg-black p-2 flex-grow',
  },
});

const WithBlueBorder = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    Wrapper: 'border-8 rounded-t-lg border-blue-400',
  },
  Meta: {
    categories: {
      Border: ['Blue'],
    },
  },
});

const WithTealBorder = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    Wrapper: 'border-8 rounded-t-lg border-teal-400',
  },
  Meta: {
    categories: {
      Border: ['Teal'],
    },
  },
});

const WithOrangeBorder = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    Wrapper: 'border-8 rounded-t-lg border-orange-400',
  },
  Meta: {
    categories: {
      Border: ['Orange'],
    },
  },
});

export default {
  Base,
  WithBlueBorder,
  WithOrangeBorder,
  WithTealBorder,
};
```

By now, this should look very familiar.  A few things to note:

- We use `asCaptionedImageToken` to define the token specifications.  This is a
  utility we exported from our clean component and provides both type safety and
  autocompletion of the design keys in our token specification.
- We create a set of tokens to produce different color variations, and attach
  necessary metadata (for the flow container component selector) via the
  reserved `Meta` domain. These tokens are not intended to be used alone, but
  rather *composed* with the `Base` token to produce the actual
  variations (by convention, such tokens are often prefixed by `With...` or
  `As...`).

### Export all the components & tokens

To finish up, export the clean component from your package as before:

   *packages/mysite/src/components/CaptionedImage/tokens/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import mysiteCaptionedImage from './mysiteCaptionedImage';
   
   export default mysiteCaptionedImage;
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/components/CaptionedImage/index.ts*

   ```ts
   import CaptionedImageClean, { asCaptionedImageToken } from './CaptionedImageClean';
   import mysiteCaptionedImage from './tokens';
   
   export { CaptionedImageClean, mysiteCaptionedImage, asCaptionedImageToken };
   ```

   *packages/mysite/src/index.ts*

   ```ts
   ...
   export * from './components/CaptionedImage';
   ```

?> **REMINDER:** Rebuild Package.

### Use the CaptionedImage token within your site

Now use it in the gallery page:
`/src/data/pages/gallery/Gallery.tsx`.

Import the new components & tokens

```ts
import { CaptionedImageClean, mysiteCaptionedImage } from 'minimal-demo';
```

and remove the tokens which apply to the captioned image (`with...Border`), and
replace the `design` with:

```ts
const design = {
  BlueImageTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.Base,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithBlueBorder,
  ),
  TealImageTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.Base,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithTealBorder,
  ),
  OrangeImageTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.Base,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithOrangeBorder,
  ),
};
```

Reload the gallery page. It should look and function exactly as before.

At this point, it is safe to delete the file
`src/data/pages/gallery/CaptionedImage.tsx` as you have successfully moved it to
the package.

> Extra Credit: Refactor and move the Gallery component itself (`Gallery.tsx`)
> using the same patterns.

## 3. Extending Tokens using Token Domains

Let's look again at our `Base` captioned image token:

```ts
const Base = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    Wrapper: 'mx-2 border-8 rounded-t-lg h-full flex flex-col',
    Image: as(
      asBodilessImage(),
      'w-full',
      withNodeKey('image'),
    ),
    Body: as(
      mysiteRichText.Simple,
      withPlaceholder('Caption'),
      withNodeKey('caption'),
    ),
    BodyWrapper: 'text-white bg-black p-2 flex-grow',
  },
});
```

### Composition token: Inverted Caption

What if we wanted to reuse this token to create a differently styled gallery
page, say one without the inverted colors in the caption. As it stands, all the
styling and behavior of our component are mixed together into a single token.
This makes it difficult to customize one aspect of the styling without recomposing
the whole token.  To simplify the process, Bodiless token specifications introduce
the notion of token "domains".

As mentioned previously, domains serve to divide a token into pieces which can
be selectively extended or overridden.  Let's rewrite the token above to separate
behavior (our editors), layout and theme:

```ts
const Base = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Editors: {
    Image: as(
      asBodilessImage(),
      withNodeKey('image')
    ),
    Body: as(
      mysiteRichText.Simple,
      withPlaceholder('Caption'),
      withNodeKey('caption'),
    ),
  },
  Layout: {
    Wrapper: 'mx-2 h-full flex flex-col',
    Image: 'w-full',
    BodyWrapper: 'p-2 flex-grow',
  },
  Theme: {
    BodyWrapper: 'text-white bg-black',
  },
  Meta: {
    categories: {
      Caption: ['Dark'],
      Source: ['Local'],
      Border: ['None'],
    },
  },
});
```

In the above example, we defined four custom domains. In general, this choice
will be based on an understanding of how the token would likely be reused or
extended by downstream consumers. In this case, we separate "editors" (the way
the component behaves to content editors), "layout" (how the individual parts of
the component are laid out within the outer container), "theme" (the look and
feel of the component, which is most likely to be overridden) and "meta" (the
categories used in the component picker for filtering.) The "core" domain wasn't
used.

Notice that if you try to compile `mysiteCaptionedImage.ts` now, you'll get a
typescript error. This is because the set of allowed domains is constrained. By
default, Bodiless only allows a single `Core` domain -- but usually a design
system will define its own set of domains once and reuse them in all their
tokens. For the sake of demonstration, we will create a system that allows six.
Also, the categories were added to define the base behavior.

### Create custom asTokenSpec

Create `packages/mysite/src/asTokenSpec.ts` with the following contents:

```ts
import { DesignableComponents, asTokenSpec as asTokenSpecBase } from '@bodiless/fclasses';

const domains = {
  Core: {},
  Schema: {},
  Layout: {},
  Theme: {},
  Meta: {},
  Editors: {},
};

type D = typeof domains;

const asTokenSpec = <C extends DesignableComponents>() => asTokenSpecBase<C, D>(domains);

export { asTokenSpec };
```

And make sure this is exported from your package by adding the following to
`packages/mysite/src/index.ts`:

```ts
export { asTokenSpec } from './asTokenSpec';
```

Now, modify the import of `asTokenSpec` in every file in your package which uses it,
so that your custom version is imported instead of the default.  This should include:

- packages/mysite/src/components/CaptionedImage/CaptionedImageClean.tsx
- packages/mysite/src/components/Element/tokens/mysiteElement.ts
- packages/mysite/src/components/Gallery/GalleryClean.tsx
- packages/mysite/src/components/RichText/tokens/mysiteRichText.ts

Now, if we want to create a variation on the captioned image without the
inverted caption. This example, will use the Base token and omit anything from
the `Theme` domain.

```ts
const LightCaption = asCaptionedImageToken(
  omit(Base, 'Theme'),
  {
    Meta: {
      categories: {
        Caption: ['Light'],
      },
    },
  }
);
```

export `LightCaption` from the token collection at the end of file.

Everything else about the token will remain the same, so we don't have to worry about
recreating the layout or plugging in the editors.

?> **REMINDER:** Rebuild Package.

Then token can now be used in `src/data/pages/gallery/Gallery.tsx` page and
create 3 additional variations in your `design{}`

```ts
  BlueImageLightCaptionTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.LightCaption,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithBlueBorder,
  ),
  TealImageLightCaptionTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.LightCaption,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithTealBorder,
  ),
  OrangeImageLightCaptionTile: on(CaptionedImageClean)(
    mysiteCaptionedImage.LightCaption,
    mysiteCaptionedImage.WithOrangeBorder,
  ),
```

Visit the gallery page and in the gallery section, click on a component and click Add and you
will see you have additional categories with Light and Dark captions that can be chosen.

### Extension token: Content sourced from CMS

We can now use our design system in a context where content comes from another
source, like an external CMS:

1. The Body is replaced with Div which by default was the RichText Component.
1. Then replace the content with an alternative source.
1. Lastly we set, the meta category: source to CMS.

```ts
// Fetch content, eg using Gatsby useStaticQuery(), use dummy content for example.
const useContentFromCMS = () => ({
  caption: 'CMS_TITLE',
  imgSrc: 'https://via.placeholder.com/600?text=CMS_IMAGE',
  imgAlt: 'CMS_IMAGE_ALT',
});

const WithContentFromCMS = asCaptionedImageToken({
  Core: {
    // Replace the default RichText starting component.
    Body: startWith(Div),
  },
  Editors: {
    Body: addProps(() => ({
      children: useContentFromCMS().caption,
    })),
    Image: addProps({
      src: useContentFromCMS().imgSrc,
      alt: useContentFromCMS().imgAlt,
    }),
  },
  Meta: {
    categories: {
      Source: ['CMS'],
    },
  },
});
```

The above example has some limitations.  The image and caption both need to know where
to get their own data, so the token cannot be used to fetch data dynamically depending,
We could perhaps enhance the example using React context, but there is an easier way.

We can simply rewrite the *clean* component:

```ts
const CMSCaptionImageClean = (props: CaptionedImageProps & { contentId: string }) => {
  const { contentId, components: C, ...rest } = props;
  const content = useContentFromCMS(contentId);
  return (
    <C.Wrapper {...rest}>
      <C.Image src={content.src} alt={content.alt} />
      <C.Body>
        {content.caption}
      </C.Body>
    </C.Wrapper>
  );
};
```

Because our new clean component uses the same design as the original, the tokens
we created for the original will apply seamlessly to this one as well. This makes
it possible to extend a component in ways which are not so easy via tokens alone,
and still leverage existing design system implementations.

### Naming convention for Extension & Composition

The difference between *extension* and *composition* is subtle, and deciding
which to use is not an exact science. As a rule of thumb:

- Use *composition* when you are adding styling or behavior which creates a
  variation of the original component which downstream consumers may choose to
  add, remove, customize, or combine with other variations. In general, export
  the tokens which produce these variations using the `With...` prefix. The
  `WithContentFromCMS` token above is a good example of when this pattern should
  be used.
- Use *extension* when you are customizing an existing token at the brand or
  site level, and especially when you want to completely override one or more
  domains from the original token, as this is not possible with composition. In
  general, do not export tokens which are meant to extend other tokens; export
  the fully extended token instead. The `LightCaption` customization described
  earlier in this article is a good example of when this pattern should be used.

This will help when you start composing your tokens into multiple variations.
You will usually only want one *extension* and can have multiple *compositions*.

## 4. Using custom Tailwind classes

The lowest level of a Bodiless design system is usually a library of utility
classes which can be applied via the [Bodiless FClasses API]() to produce
tokens. Bodiless includes built-in support for the [Tailwind]() library to
create such classes. Up til now, we have composed all our styling using
standard, out-of-the box Tailwind classes. These are often more than adequate
for things like spacing and layout, but a design system will often require
custom classes.  Let's modify our color scheme to use some custom colors.

A detailed explanation of how to create custom Tailwind clases is out of scope
for this tutorial. We recommend reading found in
[Tailwind Resources & Tips](./BuildingSites/Typography/TailwindGuide). The good
news is that much of the initial configuration is handled out of the box by
Bodiless. All you need to do is create a `tailwind.config.js` which defines your
classes.

Normally, this is created at site level.  However, since our design system is
being created in a package, it makes more sense to define our custom classes
at the package level.

### Update the package's tailwind config.js

Modify `packages/mysite/tailwind.config.js`, adding the `theme` key to the
`twConfig` definition. We also suggest to extend the colors. If you were to
leave off `extend`, you would overwrite colors and not get default tailwind
colors. If default tailwind colors are not used in the site they will be purged
and not bloat the css/package.

```js
import { getPackageTailwindConfig } from '@bodiless/fclasses';

const resolver = (pkgName) => require.resolve(pkgName);

const twConfig = {
  content: [
    './lib/**/!(*.d).{ts,js,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'mysite-teal': '#45818e',
        'mysite-blue': '#455c8e',
        'mysite-orange': '#8e5245',
      },
    },
  },
};

module.exports = getPackageTailwindConfig({
  twConfig,
  resolver,
});
```

### Use the custom colors

Then replace the colors in the CaptionImaged component borders,
`WithBlueBorder`, `withTealBorder`, `WithOrangeBorder` to the custom colors of
border-mysite-blue, border-mysite-teal, border-mysite-orange.

?> **IMPORTANT:** If you modify the Tailwind config, you must rebuild & restart
the site to have the tailwind css properly rebuild. The tailwind config creation
is part of the build and not updated on watch.

## 5. Extra Credit: Make the Footer a component at package level

Apply your learnings and create a re-useable Footer in the package by adding
clean footer component, tokens, apply some styling in those tokens and use in
the gallery page.

## 6. Creating extensible page templates

Templates in Bodiless are just large components, and are styled and extended the
same way as any other component. This makes it easy to keep parts of the page
consistent while varying others. Here, we'll convert the existing gallery page
into a template that all pages uses.

### Add the Clean Component

Create `packages/mysite/src/components/Page/PageClean.tsx`:

Let's add the PageClean and by now this should be a similar exercise to all the
rest of the components you have built.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import type { FC, HTMLProps } from 'react';
import { Page } from '@bodiless/gatsby-theme-bodiless';
import {
  ComponentOrTag, DesignableComponentsProps, Img, designable, Div, H1, A,
} from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { RichText } from '@bodiless/richtext-ui';
import { asTokenSpec } from '../../asTokenSpec';
import { GalleryClean } from '../Gallery';
import { FooterClean } from '../Footer';

// Design: set of base components which will be used in the component itself
type PageComponents = {
  Page: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Container: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  HeroLink: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  HeroImage: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  PrimaryHeader: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  BodyWrapper: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Body: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Gallery: ComponentOrTag<any>,
  Footer: ComponentOrTag<any>,
};

type PageProps =
  HTMLProps<HTMLElement> & DesignableComponentsProps<PageComponents>;

// JSX: Bare Template usually with minimal styling/functionality
const PageBase: FC<PageProps> = ({ components: C, ...rest }) => (
  <C.Page {...rest}>
    <C.Container>
      <C.HeroLink>
        <C.HeroImage />
      </C.HeroLink>
      <C.PrimaryHeader />
      <C.BodyWrapper>
        <C.Body />
      </C.BodyWrapper>
      <C.Gallery />
      <C.Footer />
    </C.Container>
  </C.Page>
);

// Designable: Define the starting sub-components of the design
const pageComponents: PageComponents = {
  Page,
  Container: Div,
  HeroLink: A,
  HeroImage: Img,
  PrimaryHeader: H1,
  BodyWrapper: Div,
  Body: RichText,
  Gallery: GalleryClean,
  Footer: FooterClean,
};

const PageClean = designable(pageComponents, 'Page')(PageBase);

const asPageToken = asTokenSpec<PageComponents>();

export default PageClean;
export { asPageToken };
```jsx
You can see all the components that were in `src/data/pages/gallery/index.tsx`
are transferred into the page component. A slight difference is we renamed the
top slots for image & link to HeroLink & HeroImage to be more precise in their
usage. This is good practice as just having Link & Image are very generic names
and not clear of purpose. In addition, we wrapped the Body with BodyWrapper
(Div) for styling. In the designable section. you will see that we transferred
the starting sub-components.

### Add the Tokens
Create `packages/mysite/src/components/Page/tokens/mysitePage.tsx`:

Then proceed with copying the styling and functionity to the correct domains &
slots.

```jsx
import { as } from '@bodiless/fclasses';
import { withNode, withNodeKey } from '@bodiless/core';
import { asBodilessImage, asBodilessLink, withPlaceholder } from '@bodiless/components';
import { mysiteRichText } from '../../RichText';
import { mysiteGallery } from '../../Gallery';
import { mysiteElement } from '../../Element';
import { mysiteFooter } from '../../Footer';
import { asPageToken } from '../PageClean';

const Base = asPageToken({
  Editors: {
    HeroLink: asBodilessLink('hero-link'),
    HeroImage: asBodilessImage('hero-image', {
      src: 'https://via.placeholder.com/6000x1200.png?text=HERO+IMAGE',
      alt: 'Hero Image',
      title: 'Hero Image',
    }),
    Body: as(
      mysiteRichText.Simple,
      withPlaceholder('Body'),
      withNodeKey('body'),
    ),
    Gallery: as(
      mysiteGallery.Base,
      withNode,
      withNodeKey('gallery-content'),
    ),
    Footer: as(mysiteFooter.Base),
  },
  Theme: {
    Container: 'container mx-auto my-2',
    PrimaryHeader: mysiteElement.H1,
  },
});

export default {
  Base,
};
```

### Add the index files and export the components

Add the index files and import/export the appropriate named components as we
have done in previous steps.

1. Add the `packages/mysite/src/components/Page/index.tsx`
1. Add the `packages/mysite/src/components/Page/tokens/index.tsx`
1. Update the `packages/minimal-demo/src/index.ts`

?> **REMINDER:** Rebuild Package.

### Update the Site's Default Template to use package's Page component

We next want to updates the sites template file `sites/mysite/src/templates/_default.jsx`

It becomes a very simple job of composing the DefaultPage with
as(mysitePage.Base)(PageClean) and exporting it.

```jsx
import { graphql } from 'gatsby';
import { PageClean, mysitePage} from '@bodiless/minimal-demo';
import { as } from '@bodiless/fclasses';

const DefaultPage = as(mysitePage.Base)(PageClean);

export default DefaultPage;

// The allSite query is extraneous and exists only to prevent
// a webpack linting error produced by default gatsby config(the $slug variable
// is used in the fragments, but the graphql doesn't pick that up and
// raises an unused parameter error).
export const query = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    ...PageQuery
    ...SiteQuery
    ...DefaultContentQuery
    allSite(filter: {pathPrefix: {eq: $slug}}) {
      edges {
        node {
          buildTime
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

Feel free to delete `sites/minimal-demo/src/components/Page/index.tsx` that came
with new site as it's no longer being used and now use our package level Page.

### Try the new template

In edit mode, click on Page | New and create a new page and go to that new page.
This page should behave identical look & behavior to the previous hard coded
gallery's index.tsx file.

If you look at the `src/data/pages/YOURPAGENAME`, you will see a single file
index.json that its contents `{ "#template": "_default" }` say its using the
site's_default tempalte.  A standard gatsby template convention.

Feel free to add components and text to your new page.

At this point, your entire site is running from code within the package and no
code is within the page. This is site of your design system package that is easy
to publish, reuse, extend in future.

A future tutorial will hook the page component to a template picker that's
allows content editor what template they would like to use.
