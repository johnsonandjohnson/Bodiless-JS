 * read and write data.  The mechanism by which those data are persisted, either
 * in memory or to a backend, is up to the store and opaque to the content node
 * and the component which uses it.  Conversely, the structure of the data held
 * the that location is up to the component and opaque to the store.
 *
 * A bodiless store must be capable of populating itself from an initial data, and
 * then responding to get, set and delete operations.  It must also be capable of
 * reporting whether an error has occurred in any of these operaitons.
