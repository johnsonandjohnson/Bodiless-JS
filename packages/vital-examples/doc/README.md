# Vital Design System Curriculum

Welcome to the VitalDS learning curriculum. Here you will find what you need to get started working
with Vital and Bodiless.

## Before you start

To help you nderstand some of the foundational ideas of VitalDS and BodilessJS, and the problems they
were created to address, you may want to watch these introductory videos.  They are a bit outdated,
so some of the specific technical details may no longer apply, but they will help you to understand
the bigger picture:


- [Life After Drupal: Becoming BodilessJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10R0ppnIGY4)
- [Introduction to BodilessJS a Gatsby based framework for editing websites](

## Important Notes

- You will need a local development environment with NodeJS v18.16 or higher.
- The working code for all these examples can be found in the
  [@bodiless/vital-examples](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/packages/vital-examples)
  package and in the [vital-examples site](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/tree/main/sites/vital-examples).
- All components and tokens created in the examples are structured accoring to very specific
  conventions described in the [Component Template](). Vital provides a scaffolding tool to help you
  create code which conforms to these conventions. You can and should use it when building each
  example:
  ```
  npx @bodiless/vital-scaffold@next
  ```
