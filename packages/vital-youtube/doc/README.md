# Vital YouTube Component

The Vital YouTube Component is based on the [BodilessJS YouTube Component](/Components/YouTube)
component. It adds features and styles to help meet typical site-use expectations.

By default, the Vital YouTube Component:

- Is set to a 16:9 aspect ratio;
- Has full-screen enablement;
- Displays the player controls;
- Has captions enabled;
- Has "modest branding" enabled â€” the YouTube logo won't be displayed in the control bar;
- Supports structured data (JSON-LD) using the `VideoObject` schema.

## Content Editor Details

Other than potentially seeing different style variations available, there is no change to the
general YouTube component experience by the Vital YouTube package, and, thus, you can refer to the
[Bodiless YouTube : Content Editor Details](/Components/YouTube#content-editor-details).

### Hero Video

If your site has been configured with the Hero component, and the _Video_ variation has been
enabled, you can switch an existing Hero component to the Video variation using the Edit Interface.

01. While in [Edit Mode](/ContenteditorUserGuide/#edit-mode), select the desired Hero Component,
    and, within its context menu, under "Hero," click **Swap**.  
    ![Hero Swap Video](./assets/HeroSwapVideo.jpg ':size=292')
01. In the _Choose a component_ form, select "Video."
01. Click the checkmark in the bottom-right of the form to confirm.
01. You can select the video URL as you would a typical YouTube component.

## Site Builder Details

As the Vital YouTube component is based on its BodilessJS counterpart, you may refer to the
[BodilessJS YouTube Component : Site Builder Details](/Components/YouTube#site-builder-details) for
general information about using the component.

### Default Player Settings

The default YouTube player settings for the Vital YouTube component can be found in
[`util.ts`](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/blob/main/packages/vital-youtube/src/components/YouTube/util.ts
':target=_blank').

For more information regarding these settings, please see:

- [BodilessJS YouTube Component : `playerSettings` Parameters](/Components/YouTube#playersettings-parameters)
- [YouTube Embedded Players and Player Parameters : Supported Parameters | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters ':target=_blank')

### Hero Video

The `vitalYouTube` token collection includes a `Hero` token, which renders a 16:9, full-width video
player, and automatically adds related structured data (JSON-LD) into the page.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { YouTubeClean, vitalYouTube } from '@bodiless/vital-youtube';
import { as } from '@bodiless/fclasses';

const VideoHero = as(vitalYouTube.Hero)(YouTubeClean);

const ExamplePage = () => (
  <ExampleWrapper>
    <VideoHero />
    ...
  </ExampleWrapper>
);
```

### Video Schema

Vital YouTube components may be used as a schema source for a Video entity. See the BodilessJS
Schema.org package's [Video Schema](/Components/Schema/#video-schema) documentation for more
information.

?> **Note:** Structured data for YouTube videos is only fetched if you set
`BODILESS_GOOGLE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with a valid API key into the site's `.env` file.
