# Package upgrade guide
This is a non-exhaustive list of packages that need to be upgraded on Bodiless.
## oidc-client-ts
- Locked at: 2.0.0-rc.2
- Reason: 2.0.0-rc.3 version introduced a few type errors into Bodiless. While these are fixable,
it's better to lock into a working version while there's no stable release available.
