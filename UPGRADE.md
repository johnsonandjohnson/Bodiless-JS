# Package upgrade guide
This is a non-exhaustive list of packages that need to be upgraded on Bodiless as soon as possible.

## gatsby
- Locked at: ~3.13.0
- Reason: version 3.14 mistakenly introduced breaking changes from the `got` package. After the
update, gatsby started intercepting errors on proxied requests, responding with a generic 500 error
instead of the original one. This affected error messages sent from `bodiless-backend`.

## oidc-client-ts
- Locked at: 2.0.0-rc.2
- Reason: 2.0.0-rc.3 version introduced a few type errors into Bodiless. While these are fixable,
it's better to lock into a working version while there's no stable release available.
